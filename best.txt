Two months ago I attended a seminar of an ESA member(Thanasis Oikonomou) about Rosetta-Philae mission.The time stopped counting for me and my curiosity increased rapidly!So many questions about the mission!How could I learn how they scheduled the mission or how a satellite is engineered? And then I saw your event and I thought...I am your guy!I should definately go there!
se my knowledge and learn by hand the process behind a successful launch.It's high time I should learn how to use the theoritical knowledge in a real problem which needs to be solved.

What's more, I have already attended courses such as "Planetary Systems ans Space Exploration", "Astronomy" and right now I am attending Cosmology, but I am not informed about the materials or the electronics that are required, so it would be ideal  if I was chosen to attend the event you are organizing so that I could learn more and have a more global view of the aspect.

Furthermore, I want to meet foreign students, talk about our same interests and learn more and more about them.Of course, I am curious about other cultures and the way they face science that I will be able to explore in this event!It's also important the security BEST provides me which spirit I want to explore.


I have to admit you...The truth is that I need your help!!I am planning a trip with my dog whose name is Mercury...guess where...to Mercury!!Here we go!
